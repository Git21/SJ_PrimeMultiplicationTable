Prime Number Multiplication Table

This program is to generate the Prime Number Multiplication Matrix of size (N+1) * (N+1)
This is not optimised to give high value prime numbers matrix. So used Integer value for finding a prime numbers.

I have written 20 test cases to cover the different test conditions and classes

No test cases written for Main program class which takes a whole number from the user and perform multiplication operations on prime numbers and display the grid.
